# Packages not in CentOS or EPEL repositories

This project makes use of the novnc and python3-websockify packages. As of now (10-june-2020) these packages have not yet been included in the official CentOS or EPEL repositories. These packages have therefore been sourced from the CentOS Community Build Service: https://cbs.centos.org/koji/.

The RPM's for these packages have been included here for completeness.
